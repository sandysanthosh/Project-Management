# Project-Management

There is no strict maximum salary for H-1B visa holders in the U.S., as it depends on factors like your experience, job role, employer, and location. However, here’s what you can expect based on your experience (8+ years in Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices):

Salary Expectations for H-1B (2025)

1. Consulting Companies (TCS, Infosys, Cognizant, etc.)

If you switch to contract-based roles, you might get $80–100/hour, which translates to $160K – $200K per year.

### How much service company bill to client

Service-based companies (like TCS, Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro, Capgemini, etc.) charge clients significantly more than what they pay their employees. The billing rate depends on factors like client location, job role, experience, and contract type (fixed bid vs. time & material).

Typical Billing Rates for H-1B Consultants in the U.S. (2025)

1. Junior Developers (2–5 years experience)

Billing Rate: $40 – $80 per hour

Annual Equivalent: $80K – $160K per year


2. Mid-Level Developers (6–10 years experience)

Billing Rate: $70 – $120 per hour

Annual Equivalent: $140K – $240K per year


3. Senior Developers / Leads (10+ years experience)

Billing Rate: $100 – $160 per hour

Annual Equivalent: $200K – $320K per year


4. Architects / Managers

Billing Rate: $150 – $250 per hour

Annual Equivalent: $300K – $500K per year


How Much Do Companies Keep?

For an H-1B consultant earning $120K per year, a service company might be billing the client $180K – $240K per year (1.5x to 2x the salary).
For contract roles, the difference is even higher.

If you move to direct contracting (Corp-to-Corp / C2C) instead of working through a service company, you can increase your earnings by 30–50%. Let me know if you want guidance on maximizing your H-1B salary!

### How company bill to client what all the factors they include in billing

How Companies Bill Clients & Factors Included in Billing

When service-based companies (TCS, Cognizant, Infosys, etc.) bill their clients, they consider multiple factors. The billing model depends on the agreement type, resource experience, project complexity, and business costs.


---

1. Billing Models Used by IT Service Companies

1.1 Time & Material (T&M) Model

Billing per hour/day/month based on actual work done

Clients pay for actual hours spent by developers and consultants

Common in staff augmentation and support projects


Example:

If a Senior Developer is billed at $100/hour and works 160 hours/month, the client pays:

$16,000 per month (~$192K per year)




---

1.2 Fixed-Price Model

Fixed cost for the entire project, regardless of actual time spent

Clients prefer this when scope and timeline are well-defined

Risk is on the IT company to complete work within budget


Example:

A bank hires Cognizant for a new online banking system for $10M

Cognizant delivers it over 12 months, using a team of 20



---

1.3 Managed Services Model

IT company provides ongoing support & maintenance for a fixed monthly fee

Often used for Application Maintenance & Support (AMS) contracts


Example:

TCS manages a retail company’s ERP system for $2M per year

The team includes 5 developers, 2 testers, and 1 project manager



---

2. Factors That Influence Billing Rates

2.1 Employee Cost (Salary & Benefits)

Base salary of the employee (~40–50% of billing)

Benefits: H-1B sponsorship, healthcare, retirement plans


Example:

If an H-1B employee earns $120K, the company will bill the client $180K – $240K per year



---

2.2 Overheads & Operational Costs

Office space, internet, laptops, and software licenses

HR, recruitment, legal fees, compliance (H-1B visa, taxes, insurance)

Onshore & offshore team costs


Example:

If an offshore developer earns ₹20 LPA (India), the client might be billed $60K – $100K per year



---

2.3 Profit Margin

Most service companies charge 20–50% profit on top of actual cost

For high-demand skills (Cloud, AI, Cybersecurity), profit can go up to 100%


Example:

If a Java Developer costs the company $100K per year, they may bill $180K – $220K



---

2.4 Location-Based Pricing (Onshore vs. Offshore)

Onshore (USA, UK, Canada) → Higher billing rates ($80 – $200/hour)

Offshore (India, Philippines) → Lower billing rates ($20 – $50/hour)


Example:

A project might have:

Onsite Lead (USA) → Billed at $140/hour

Offshore Developers (India) → Billed at $30/hour




---

2.5 Skill & Experience Level


---

3. How Companies Maximize Profits

1. Onshore-Offshore Model – Keep key resources onsite at high rates, but most work offshore at lower costs


2. Long-Term Contracts – Lock clients into multi-year contracts with increasing prices


3. Resource Pyramiding – More juniors, fewer seniors (e.g., 1 Architect + 5 Junior Developers)


4. Change Requests – Charge extra for anything outside the original contract




---

Maximizing Your Own Salary

If you are working through a service company, they keep 30–50% of the billing

Direct contract roles (C2C) let you earn closer to the actual billing rate

Moving into high-demand roles (Cloud, AI, Solution Architect) can increase billing
